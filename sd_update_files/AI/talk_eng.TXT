Would you like to go on a color adventure with me?

I've learned them all! Now, do you want to see which color I've seen the most?
This color came up the most! From now on, I remember this color the best!
Shall we check which colors I learned best from the ones you took?
You can see the most captured color in this graph!
Ta-da! I think I learned red the best!
